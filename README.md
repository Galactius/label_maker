# Python Label Maker

This program was developed by Daniel Perez during the 2022 Villanova Vatican Internship program, under supervision of 
Fr. Joseph Farrell of the Roman Augustinian Curia.

**Note this program is intended for use on MacOS exclusively!**

This program was used to create labels that are automatically printed out upon creation. This program is purposefully 
straightforward as to assist future interns in developing this project in the future even if they have limited 
experience in Python. 

This program features a Tkinter GUI, Microsoft Word Doc generation, conversion to PDF, automatic printing using the 
default system printer (if one is available), and a simple MacOS .app executable.

This program makes use of various python packages, to avoid issues with dependencies a "requirements.txt" file has been
provided with this repository. Use the ```pip install -r requirements.txt command``` in a terminal at the desired working 
directory to install all required dependencies. Please install dependencies before trying to run the script (this does
not apply to running the .app executable). 

Future plans include a complete re-work of the GUI (see the test branch for further information), implementing 
error-catching and further input validation, as well as other features as requested by Fr. Joesph Farrell.
