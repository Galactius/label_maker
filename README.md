# Python Label Maker

This program was developed by Daniel Perez during the 2022 Villanova Vatican Internship program, under supervision of 
Fr. Joseph Farrell of the Roman Augustinian Curia.

**Note this program is intended for use on MacOS exclusively!**

This program was used to create labels using Microsoft Word that are automatically printed out upon creation. This
program is purposefully straightforward as to assist future interns in developing this project in the future even if 
they have limited experience in Python. 

This program features a Tkinter GUI, Microsoft Word Doc generation, conversion to PDF, automatic printing using the 
default printer (if one is setup), and a simple MacOS .app executable.

Future plans include a complete re-work of the GUI (see the test branch for further information), implementing 
error-catching and further input validation, as well as other features as requested by Fr. Joesph Farrell.
